#+TITLE: Best practices for A* on grids (maps)

* Description

  These maps assume the same file format as [[http://web.cs.du.edu/~sturtevant/papers/benchmarks.pdf][Nathan Sturtevant's Benchmarks for
  Grid-Based Pathfinding (2012)]].  The maps are human readable and the syntax for
  defining them is self explanatory (see [[./example.map][example.map]]), but a description of the
  map format is available [[http://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/formats.html][here]].

  Many more benchmark maps from a variety of commercial video games are
  available from movingai.com [[http://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/index.html][here]].
