* Description
  Some simple pathfinding code, featuring the A*, LRTA*, and Fringe Search
  algorithms.  Feel free to use this source code as an example to build your own
  implementation off of.
* Usage
  If you have `g++` installed, you should be able to compile and run a demo
  with:
  #+begin_src bash
  make
  #+end_src
  
  You should see some output resembling the following:

  #+begin_src bash
  LRTA* (suboptimal):
  Total problems: 100000
  Mean nodes expanded: 279
  Mean path length: 279
  Mean path cost: 409.742
  Mean open list size: 0
  Total time (sec): 1.62758

  Basic A*:
  Total problems: 100000
  Mean nodes expanded: 192
  Mean path length: 33
  Mean path cost: 73.2619
  Mean open list size: 45
  Total time (sec): 3.14056

  Fringe search:
  Total problems: 100000
  Mean nodes expanded: 193
  Mean path length: 33
  Mean path cost: 73.2619
  Mean open list size: 0
  Total time (sec): 4.68347

  A* with a heap and tiebreaking on larger g:
  Total problems: 100000
  Mean nodes expanded: 187
  Mean path length: 33
  Mean path cost: 73.2619
  Mean open list size: 46
  Total time (sec): 3.25745
